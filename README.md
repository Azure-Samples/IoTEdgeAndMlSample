# Machine Learning and IoT Edge 

Frequently, IoT applications want to take advantage of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge. In this sample, we walk you through training a machine learning model with data collected from IoT devices in the cloud, deploying that model to IoT Edge, and maintaining and refining the model periodically. 

# Instructions for completing the walk-through

The detailed walk-through instructions for this sample can be found in the [EdgeAndMlWalkthrough.pdf](./EdgeAndMlWalkthrough.pdf).

At a high-level the sample has the following steps:
1. Set up development machine - [Dev VM](./DevVM) folder
1. Add IoT Hub and configure storage
1. Generate device data and send to IoT Hub [Device Harness](./DeviceHarness) folder
1. Train and deploy ML model [Azure Notebooks](./AzureNotebooks)
1. Configure IoT Edge device [Edge VM](./EdgeVM) folder
1. Create IoT Edge modules [Edge Modules](./EdgeModules) folder
1. Send device data through IoT Edge device[Leaf Device](./LeafDevice) folder
